The bluebox is a USB-powered ground station box for the AAUSAT3 cubesat satellite

The device firmware, control software and hardware is licensed under the MIT license.

How to build and flash the firmware
------------------------------------

In order to communicate with device without being root, write this line to /etc/udev/rules.d/49-bluebox.rules:
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1d50", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6666", MODE:="0666"

And this line to /etc/udev/rules.d/49-atmel.rules:
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="03eb", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2ff4", MODE:="0666"

Now, compile and flash the software. The bbctl bootloader step can be omitted if you're flashing the device for the first time.

$ cd bluebox/software/firmware
$ make clean all
$ ../bbctl/bbctl bootloader
$ make program

Finally, test the device by reading back the silicon revision of the ADF7021 RF chip:

$ cd bluebox/software/bbtcl
$ ./bbctl version
0x2104
